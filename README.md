# Flask-site

Trying to use Flask to get a website that accomplishes my original goal for my Code Louisville front-end web development track

This site will pull urls from social shares across networks and aggregate them, and list them.

I have gotten the most recent 25 tweets and managed to scrape the titles and URLs of social shares.
